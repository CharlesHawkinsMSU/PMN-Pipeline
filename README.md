The pipeline used by the [Plant Metabolic Network](https://plantcyc.org) to generate pathway-genome databases

For a quickstart guide see [here](Quickstart.md)

The full manual is [here](Manual.md)

The recommended way to run this is using the Singularity container; build scripts are in the [pmn-container](https://github.com/CharlesHawkinsMSU/pmn-container) repo.
