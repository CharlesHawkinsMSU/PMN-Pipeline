On the assumption that the real genome should actually contain orthologs for all the proteins in the database, the percentage of them that HMMER successfully finds is taken to be a good proxy measure for the overall percentage of the genome that the sequencing effort recovered successfully. PMN uses a cutoff of 75% to include a genome in our network."
