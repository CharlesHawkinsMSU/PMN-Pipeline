If a frame is in multiple of the reference kbs and is annotated to the species of :kb in all of them, then reference kb's toward the front of the :refs list are preferred as sources for import. Refine-b will attempt to find existing frames in :kb that match the imports and replace them with the improted frames. For pathways only a matching frame ID is checked. For enzymes, accession-1, accession-2, and synonyms in :kb are checked against accession-1 and accession-2 in :refs if a matching frame-ID is not found. Both the enzyme and its gene are checked for matches. The :choices argument lets you manually specify matching frames between :kb and :refs. It is commonly used when a gene can be matched between :kb and :refs but one or more of its proteins cannot or vice-versa (which would cause an error). It should be an alist from orgids to a list of pairs (or triplets) where the first value is the frame ID in the orgid and the second is the corresponding frame ID in the reference kb.

; The following three functions, (enzrxns-in-file), (rename-enzrxns), and

; name-collisions between the enzrxns to be imported and existing enzrxns in
; the PGDB. This is mostly a danger for the incrementally-updated PGDBs which
; need to have enzymes with attached enzrxns imported from the reference KBs
; that may have come from a previous version of the same PGDB, because the
; template for auto-assigning enzrxn names is based on the PGDB unique ID (e.g.
; QT for AraCyc) which does not change from one PGDB version to the next
;
; They way to use these is: 
; 	1. Export the enzymes from the reference PGDB with 'EV-AS and 'EV-EXP (or whatever
; evidence codes you want)
; 	2. In the new PGDB, call (enzrxns-in-file) on the exported lisp file to get a
; list of all enzrxns in that file
; 	3. Call (rename-enzymes) on the list you just got. This will find enzrxns
; 	in the current kb that have the same ID as enzrxns in the list, and renames
; 	the ones in the current kb. Save the list it returns
; 	4. Import the lisp file
; 	5. Call merge-renamed-enzrxns on the list returned by (enzrxns-in-file). This
; will deal with the case that the existing and newly-imported enzrxn were
; actually the same after all and now you have duplicate enzrxns. It will merge
