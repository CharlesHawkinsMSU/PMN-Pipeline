; Functions for running refine-b for the PMN pipeline. Refine-b is the step that pulls proteins and pathways from reference databases into a newly-created database if they are annotated to the species, where the reference databases are metacyc, plantcyc, and, in the case of the incrementally-updated pgdbs, the previous version of the same pgdb

  "Runs refine-b on the given orgid. Searches for enzymes and pathways in the reference kbs in :refs (by default metacyc and plantcyc) that are annotated to the organism of the pgdb :kb (default is the currently-selected organism). It then imports all of these frames from the reference kbs into the current kb. If a frame is in multiple of the reference kbs and is annotated to the species of :kb in all of them, then reference kb's toward the front of the :refs list are preferred as sources for import. Refine-b will attempt to find existing frames in :kb that match the imports and replace them with the improted frames. For pathways only a matching frame ID is checked. For enzymes, accession-1, accession-2, and synonyms in :kb are checked against accession-1 and accession-2 in :refs if a matching frame-ID is not found. Both the enzyme and its gene are checked for matches. The :choices argument lets you manually specify matching frames between :kb and :refs. It is commonly used when a gene can be matched between :kb and :refs but one or more of its proteins cannot or vice-versa (which would cause an error). It should be an alist from orgids to a list of pairs (or triplets) where the first value is the frame ID in the orgid and the second is the corresponding frame ID in the reference kb. A third value, if present, is the reference kb to draw from; otherwise the first kb in :refs that has the given frame ID will be used. Example: '((myorg (myorgg-22432 g-1391) (myorgg-3481-MONOMER g-1925-MONOMER plant) (myorgg-1119 g-5481 meta)) (someotherorg (soo-5879 g-3911))). Only frame-ids are accepted, so it is not necessary to specify if the mapping is for a gene or an enzyme. Entries in :choices override matches made based on accessions or synonyms, but not frame-id since that could create a conflict"
